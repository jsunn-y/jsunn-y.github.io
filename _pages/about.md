I'm a 3rd-year Chemical Engineering PhD student at Caltech, coadvised by [Professor Frances Arnold]() and [Professor Yisong Yue](). My research interests involve developing machine learning-assisted workflows for protein engineering, and particularly enzymes. I am interning this summer at Profluent.

I completed my undergraduate degree in chemical engineering and applied math at Yale University. During my undergrad, I worked on membranes for water treatment with Professor Menachem Elimelech, and molecular simulation and machine learning of polymers with Professor Ying Li. In the past, I have also interned at Genentech and NREL.

Outside of research, I enjoy electronic music and exploring new places and foods. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring other students.
