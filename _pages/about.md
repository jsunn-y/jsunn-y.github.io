I'm a 4th-year chemical engineering PhD candidate at Caltech, coadvised by [Professor Frances Arnold](http://fhalab.caltech.edu) and [Professor Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com), where I am supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org) and the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/). I am primarily interested in developing machine learning-assisted workflows for protein engineering, particularly for discovering and optimizing enzymes. I interned this past summer at [Profluent](https://www.profluent.bio), and I am also a co-organizer for the ML for protein engineering [seminar series](https://www.ml4proteinengineering.com).

I completed my BS in chemical engineering and applied math at Yale University. During my undergrad, I worked on membranes for water treatment with [Professor Menachem Elimelech](https://elimelechlab.yale.edu), and molecular simulation and machine learning of polymers with [Professor Ying Li](https://pdelab.engr.wisc.edu). In the past, I have also interned at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com) and [NREL](https://www.nrel.gov).

Outside of research, I enjoy [electronic music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RPKYnhJRLfIiuhpknQyNw?si=7f38795ed03c4194), exploring new places and foods, and learning about history and philosophy. I also enjoy teaching, mentoring, and collaboration. Please reach out!
