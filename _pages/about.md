I'm a 3rd-year chemical engineering PhD student at Caltech, coadvised by [Professor Frances Arnold](http://fhalab.caltech.edu) and [Professor Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com). My research interests involve developing machine learning-assisted workflows for protein engineering, and particularly enzymes. I am interning this summer at [Profluent](https://www.profluent.bio).

I completed my undergraduate degree in chemical engineering and applied math at Yale University. During my undergrad, I worked on membranes for water treatment with [Professor Menachem Elimelech](https://elimelechlab.yale.edu), and molecular simulation and machine learning of polymers with [Professor Ying Li](https://pdelab.engr.wisc.edu). In the past, I have also interned at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com) and [NREL](https://www.nrel.gov).

Outside of research, I enjoy [electronic music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RPKYnhJRLfIiuhpknQyNw?si=7f38795ed03c4194), exploring new places and foods, and learning about history and philosophy. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring other students.
